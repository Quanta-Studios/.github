# Quanta Studios

Do a naming scheme for every project in lower case, hyphens, like this:
<genre>-<codename>

For example, rts-redrock

A group of devs, game designers, modellers and more all working together to make great games.
We participate in game jams, and are also developing some larger projects in the background - stay tuned!
